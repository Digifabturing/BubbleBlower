This is the first project tackled by the Fablab team in order to open future
activities and landscapes of research in the experimentation process with the Robotic Arm made in Comau.
Such research represent the first step into a series of experimentations with the application of 
robotic devices into fields of art, architecture and design.
This first project aim to humanize the robotic arm by transforming it into a bubble blower with few simple tools available inside of a fablab.
The custom tool was designed for an easy production with a lasercutter and with common materials that anyone can find in an hardware store; all the design and code are open and shared in creative commons.
